# MoMAColors
Palettes inspired by works at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

This is the sister package to [`MetBrewer`](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer), which contains color schemes based arounda artwork at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
Structure of the package was based on coding from the [`PNWColors`](https://github.com/jakelawlor/PNWColors) and [`wesanderson`](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) packages.
